# Cybersecurity Walkthroughs & Writeups

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository! This collection features detailed walkthroughs of vulnerable machines, CTF challenges, and practical penetration testing scenarios. Each writeup follows industry-standard methodologies and provides comprehensive explanations for educational purposes.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **Learning resource** for cybersecurity students and professionals
- **Reference material** for penetration testing methodologies
- **Study guide** for certification preparation
- **Documentation** of practical security research and analysis

---

## What You'll Find

### Vulnerable Machines
- **VulnHub** machines with step-by-step exploitation guides
- **HackTheBox** retired machines and challenges
- **DockerLabs** walkthroughs and solutions

### Practical Labs
- Custom penetration testing scenarios
- Real-world vulnerability analysis
- Security tool tutorials and guides

--- 

## Methodology

Each walkthrough follows a structured approach:

1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering and enumeration
2. **Initial Access** - Vulnerability identification and exploitation
3. **Post-Exploitation** - System exploration and persistence
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Gaining higher-level access
5. **Documentation** - Findings summary and remediation recommendations

## Current Content

### VulnHub Machines
- ✅ **[Symfonos2](./vulnhub/Symfonos2.md)** - SMB enumeration, FTP exploitation, web app RCE, MySQL privilege escalation

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with networking concepts
- Virtual machine software (VMware/VirtualBox)
- Penetration testing tools (Kali Linux recommended)

### How to Use
1. **Read the writeup** thoroughly before attempting
2. **Set up the lab environment** on VMware or VirtualBox
3. **Follow along step-by-step** with your own instance
4. **Experiment** with alternative approaches
5. **Practice** the techniques on similar machines

## ⚠️ Ethical Use Disclaimer

**Important:** This repository is for educational purposes only. All techniques and tools demonstrated should only be used on:
- Your own systems and networks
- Explicitly authorized penetration testing engagements
- Dedicated learning environments (VulnHub, HackTheBox, DockerLabs, etc.)

**Never** use these techniques on systems you don't own or lack explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.
